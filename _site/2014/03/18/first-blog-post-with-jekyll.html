      <h2>First Blog Post with Jekyll</h2>

      <p>So as the title explains, this is my first blog post with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
My first impression so far is really good. This is an awesome tool for generating
a blog, and it's really easy to deploy with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.
This is just my "Hello World!" post, so in a while I will create a post of how I
set up Jekyll with Github Pages.</p>
