      <p>At first I was skeptical. The JSX files meant writing xml like syntax in your JavaScript and I thought it looked kind of weird. At the same time I read a blog post expressing the important to give something a try before declaring it stupid. Give it 5 minutes at least.</p>

<p>React is developed at Facebook. It can be used as the V in a MVC framework like Backbone, Angular or Ember. React uses a virtual DOM diff to determine what to re-render. Unlike Backbone Views, React will check the virtual DOM and only render the what needs to.</p>

<p>Right now I am working on a web application that needs to be light-weight and perform well on tablets and phones. The virtual DOM feature suits this well I think. So to summarize. I think React.js is great and I am happy I gave it a try. </p>
