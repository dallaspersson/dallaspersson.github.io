    This is a blog. It's my attempt to make a small contribution to the cool
    stuff that is floating around the internet. But for the most part this will
    be where I put some of the things I learn or come across into writing just
    to document. For this pre-phase I will most likely blog about how I improve
    this site.

        <p><p>So as the title explains, this is my first blog post with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
My first impression so far is really good. This is an awesome tool for generating
a blog, and it's really easy to deploy with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.
This is just my "Hello World!" post, so in a while I will create a post of how I
set up Jekyll with Github Pages.</p>
