          <!-- <p><p>At first I was skeptical. The JSX files meant writing xml like syntax in your JavaScript and I thought it looked kind of weird. At the same time I read a blog post expressing the important to give something a try before declaring it stupid. Give it 5 minutes at least.</p>

          <!-- <p><p>Icons are used a lot in web applications. Most of the time I use icons from
Glyphicons or Font Awesome. They have free sets of icons that you can use and
Glyphicons Halflings are included with Bootstrap. These icons are wrapped as a
font which means that they are vector based. So compared to bitmap images they
scale to any size and still look pixel-perfect. And this also means that you
will not have to worry about different screen resolutions, such as retina displays.</p>

          <!-- <p><p>So as the title explains, this is my first blog post with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
My first impression so far is really good. This is an awesome tool for generating
a blog, and it's really easy to deploy with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.
This is just my "Hello World!" post, so in a while I will create a post of how I
set up Jekyll with Github Pages.</p>
