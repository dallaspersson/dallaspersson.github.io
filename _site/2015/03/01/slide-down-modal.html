      <p>Yesterday I saw this nice looking modal on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a>
while changing my profile picture. It used a cubic bezier transition that gave it
a cool bounce. So inspired of this, I tried to imitate the modal I saw on Soundcloud.</p>

<p>I thought that the easiest way was to do it using codepen. Since then, I can show
this at work before implementing. This would probably be possible using only css,
but I need to support basic functionality for older browsers so I use some
JavaScript to calculate available space and such. There is not really that much
to say. Here is the <a href="http://codepen.io/oscarpersson/full/PwaBNm/">Codepen</a>.</p>

<p>Also put it up as Github <a href="https://gist.github.com/dallaspersson/6c4a611c27404a6bf67a">Gist</a>.</p>
