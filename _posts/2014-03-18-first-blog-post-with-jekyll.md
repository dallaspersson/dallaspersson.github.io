title: First Blog Post with Jekyll
tags: [jekyll, web, github]

So as the title explains, this is my first blog post with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
My first impression so far is really good. This is an awesome tool for generating
a blog, and it&#39;s really easy to deploy with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
This is just my &quot;Hello World!&quot; post, so in a while I will create a post of how I
set up Jekyll with Github Pages.
