Yesterday I saw this nice looking modal on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
while changing my profile picture. It used a cubic bezier transition that gave it
a cool bounce. I currently want to improve a modal used at work. So inspired of
this, I tried to imitate the modal I saw on Soundcloud.

I thought that the easiest way was to do it using codepen. Since then, I can show
this at work before implementing. This would probably be possible using only css,
but I need to support basic functionality for older browsers so I use some
JavaScript to calculate available space and such. There is not really that much
to say. Here is the [Codepen](http://codepen.io/oscarpersson/full/PwaBNm/).
